	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Emma Gail and I am currently a PhD student at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. 
	My current research interests involve creating workflows to better understand protein interactions,
	especially in regard to one of the focuses of my <a href="https://www.davidovich-lab.com">current lab</a>: PRC2 and its accessory subunits. 
	This is the home to my publicly available code/documentation and related updates. </p>
